# FlightJS demo

Simple todo app built with:
- Flight: event-based web framework created by Twitter and built on top of jQuery),
- Redux: predicatable state container for JavaScript apps and
- Semantic-UI: UI toolkit

Main focus was on Flight.

Minimal learning curve if you are already acquainted with jQuery. Makes you group event bindings in components. Components communicate between each other only via events.

*But why, Twitter, why still using RequireJS? It's 2016 and NPM and browserify/webpack rules the world when building frontend Javascript applications!*

*PS.: I know Twitter ships NPM version of Flight but it can't be used to its fullest potential.*
